<h3>A tray of tacos and sides</h3>
<p>Beef Tacos are a favorite Taco Tuesday dinner for my family! Over the years I’ve tweaked how I’ve made them and this is definitely my favorite way to make tacos. I usually make two pounds of ground beef, so we have some leftovers. I love serving these with some fresh Pico de Gallo and some Pomegranate Guacamole!</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 ground beef</li>
    <li>1 chopped onion</li>
    <li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 each of salt and pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp cayenne</li>
    <li>4 tsp chilli powder</li>
    <li>2 tsp each of cumin and dried cliantro</li>
    <li>c11/2 ups of beef broth</li>
    <li>white corn tortillas</li>
    <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
    <li>shredded monterey jack cheese</li>
    <li>taco toppings</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add the ground beef to the skillet. Add the chopped onion and cook until the ground beef is browned. Drain as much of the grease from the meat as you can.

        Next, season with the taco seasonings. I like to use salt, pepper, cayenne, chili powder, dried cilantro, and cumin. You could also use a taco seasoning packet, but I prefer this blend of seasonings.
        
        Once the meat is seasoned, add about 1 1/2 cups of beef broth and stir well. Bring this to a quick boil, reduce the heat, and cover with a lid.
        
        This will simmer on low for about 20 minutes or until the liquid has started to reduce. If the liquid hasn’t reduced, remove the lid and let it continue cooking a little bit longer.</li>
        <li>
            Once the meat is ready, in a clean skillet add 1-2 tbsp of oil. I usually use olive oil or avocado oil.

Lay out a few of the white corn tortillas in the skillet. Add a small handful of the shredded Monterey Jack cheese to the tortillas. Next, add a spoonful of the taco meat.
